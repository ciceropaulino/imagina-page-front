## Projeto de página web para laboratório IMAGINA - Desenvolvimento de Sistemas Web I

</div>

# IMAGINA Lab Front-End

> This project was developed for the web 1 subject of IT Graduation on UFRN. This component has focus
on web front-end development.

### About:
This project is built as a Modern Single-Page Application (SPA) using React and Vite build tool. 
The architecture is designed for scalability, featuring clear separation of concerns: Axios handles
API communication, while React Router DOM manages client-side navigation. For styles, the approach is
combining the utility-first speed of Tailwind CSS with the professional, pre-built components of
MUI (Material UI). By organizing code into logical domains (such as features/ for authentication
and store/ for global state management), the project maintains high predictability and is well-structured
for future expansion with collaboration of IMAGINA Research Lab members.

### How run:
#### Clone the repo:
```git clone https://github.com/ciceropaulino/imagina-page-front.git```
#### Run:
```npm install && npm run dev```
